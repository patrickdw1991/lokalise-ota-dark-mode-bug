# lokalise-ota-dark-mode-bug
Project to show lokalise what's happening with dark mode and to reproduce it in a simple sample app.

Steps to reproduce:
- Open the app
- Switch around tabs (see that everything is dark mode :) )
- Click on the FAB button
- Close the newly opened activity
- Switch around in the tabs (see that the background now shows white)


Video of this can be found in sample.webm
